# **Aim**:Character-Level Transliteration using RNN-based Seq2Seq Models on the [Dakshina Dataset](https://storage.googleapis.com/gresearch/dakshina/dakshina_dataset_v1.0.tar) .

This dataset consists of 12 Indian languages. Since my mother tongue is Bengali, I have chosen Englishâ€“Bengali transliteration for this project.
