# **Aim**:Character-Level Transliteration using RNN-based Seq2Seq Models on the [Dakshina Dataset](https://storage.googleapis.com/gresearch/dakshina/dakshina_dataset_v1.0.tar) .

This dataset consists of 12 Indian languages. Since my mother tongue is Bengali, I have chosen Englishâ€“Bengali transliteration for this project.
# **Key Steps to Achieve the Aim:**
[The code is organized and explained step-by-step in the Jupyter Notebook. Each step is numbered for clarity. In this README file, I have described the implementation by referring to the corresponding step numbers from the notebook. This makes it easier to follow the logic and match the explanation with the actual code.]

**Step 1:**

I have loaded the file paths for the training, validation, and test datasets.

**Step 2:**
